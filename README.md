# Quantitative Models for Data Science Project
We consider measurements of a sample of abalones (a type of mollusk).The age of an abalone is determined by cutting the shell
through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings (R) through a microscope, which is a boring
and time-consuming task. Other measurements (we will suppose to have data about Length, Depth, Height and
Weight), which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age.
